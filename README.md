# Comprehension Question Answering using BERT
A simple UI where clients can submit a context and question to get answers using BERT

### Installation and Usage

You need to have Python, React JS and Node JS installed in your system

pip install the requirements.txt
npm install the clients folder

I am using Flask for the backend server of the code and ReactJS for client facing UI. To run the server use  ```flask run```in thebase folder and to start the UI use ```npm start``` inside client folder.

Have fun!!
